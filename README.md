Instructions
The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating. You've been contracted by the editors of a food magazine, Eat Safe, Love, to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles.

Part 1: Database and Jupyter Notebook Set Up
Use NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb for this section of the challenge.

Import the data provided in the establishments.json file from your Terminal. Name the database uk_food and the collection establishments. Copy the text you used to import your data from your Terminal to a markdown cell in your notebook.

Part 2: Update the Database
Use NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb for this section of the challenge.

The magazine editors have some requested modifications for the database before you can perform any queries or analysis for them. Make the following changes to the establishments collection:

An exciting new halal restaurant just opened in Greenwich, but hasn't been rated yet. The magazine has asked you to include it in your analysis. Add the following information to the database:

Part 3: Exploratory Analysis
Eat Safe, Love has specific questions they want you to answer, which will help them find the locations they wish to visit and avoid.

Use NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb for this section of the challenge.

Some notes to be aware of while you are exploring the dataset:

RatingValue refers to the overall rating decided by the Food Authority and ranges from 1-5. The higher the value, the better the rating.
Note: This field also includes non-numeric values such as 'Pass', where 'Pass' means that the establishment passed their inspection but isn't given a number rating. We will coerce non-numeric values to nulls during the database setup before converting ratings to integers.
The scores for Hygiene, Structural, and ConfidenceInManagement work in reverse. This means, the higher the value, the worse the establishment is in these areas.
